* machina
** concepts
*** basic concepts
   - it is a map
   - it contains a key called `:state` which
     indicates the "current state".
   - the initial state is `:machina/start`
   - the final state is `:machina/stop`
   - by default, if you attempt to transition from `:machina/stop`
     you receive the same sm that you stated with.
     It is called the `identity` transition.
   - each state correspond to an action called `transition`
   - each transition is just a function form state to state
     f(sm) -> sm'
   - if the machine doesn't know how to transition to the next
   - state it goes to a `:machina/halted` state.
   - by default, if you attempt to transition from `:machina/halted`
     an exception will be thrown.

*** basic diaptch model fn vs multi-methods

   - transitions stored in `:machina/dispatch`
   - one function to transition from a state to another
     and it is called `transition`

** examples
*** simplest machine from start -> stop
   - intro `with-dispatch`
   - intro `move-to`
*** simple counter: start -> count-down -> stop
   - iterate
   - take-while stop
   - intro `simple-machina`
   - intro `move-if`
   - intro `until-stopped`
   - intro wrappers with show-transitions
*** write-to-file: :start -> :write-to-file <-> :sleep
   - let it blow
   - Manage errors transition-by-transition
   - intro `default-machina`
   - intro `default-wrapper`
   - introduce error management
